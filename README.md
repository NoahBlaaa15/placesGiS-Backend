# placesGiS Backend and Frontend
The Backend written in NodeJS for my placesGiS Application: https://github.com/NoahBlaaa15/placesGiS 

## Backend Structure
I used Express to develop my Web structure fast and reliable.
On / is the main Page and if it gets Parameters in the URL it processes the Data given.

## Frontend
The Frontend is developed by my Friend in Bootstrap. 
I change some values, so I could use it in the view engine Vash.
